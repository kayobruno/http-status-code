    "description": "The \"HTTP Status Code Abstraction\" project is a PHP 8-based initiative aimed at simplifying the management and usage of HTTP status codes by introducing ENUM support. HTTP status codes are integral to web development, providing vital information about the success or failure of HTTP requests and responses. However, managing and referencing these status codes in a clear and organized manner can often be challenging. This project seeks to address this challenge by leveraging PHP 8's ENUM feature.",
